# Brokering Additive Manufacturing Living Lab WebApp (Trial 2)

This is the 2nd trial of creating a webapp for our Brokering Additive Manufacturing agent-based manufacturing platform for our living lab experiments.

Taking learnings from trial one, we have moved to a new stack using svelte to build the webapp and have refined the interface to handle more types of printer with different connectivity and gcode flavours.
